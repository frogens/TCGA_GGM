# Graphical Gaussian Models to model Gene inference using the TCGA database

This repository provides a pipeline for constructing Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM) using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. The implementation uses TCGAbiolinks, a powerful R/Bioconductor package, to retrieve and preprocess gene expression data before inferring gene-gene interaction networks.
